# Candidate Key Finder

This C program analyzes a relational database schema, including functional dependencies, to identify candidate keys. It performs steps such as finding attributes not on the left or right side of any functional dependency, determining attributes only on the right or left side, and combining these sets to check for candidate keys. If a candidate key is not found, it also identifies candidate keys considering attributes not in certain sets
